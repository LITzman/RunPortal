# RunPortal

A small project to learn some JavaScript.

*I LIKE CLEAN DESKTOP*
But still, I need some basic functionality.
This app let's you launch the apps that you run 90% of the time, using keyboard only!

Uses Electron + React + Vite.

## usage
When the app runs, use `ctrl+alt+f` to launch the portal.
It will display all your shortcuts.

Use one of the keyboard keys the portal suggests to launch the app associated with it!

To modify your shortcuts right-click the tray icon and select `Edit Shortcuts`.
